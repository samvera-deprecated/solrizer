h2. 1.1.1

BUG: Trying to index the children of proxy terms (can't access them in OM).  Added a check to make sure it doesn't do this.
BUG: Not responding to messages of type: "modifyDatastreamByReference"
BUG: Not logging unavailable message types


h2. 1.0.3

BUG: Extractor.format_field_values was choking when value was nil

h2. 1.0.0

Deprecated

* extract_tag
* extract_tags
* extract_hash


All solrize and extract methods now accept and return a _Hash_ rather than a Solr::Document
Removed dependency on outdated "solr" gem, replaced it with RSolr
As part of this switch, *all field names are stored as Strings, not Symbols*. If you previously accessed something as solr_doc[:title_t], now you need to access it as solr_doc["title_t"] 

Moved #format_node_value and #insert_solr_field_value from TerminologyBasedSolrizer to Solrizer::Extractor 

h2. 0.3.1

fix in require statements

h2. 0.3.0

HYDRA-286 Re-structure Solrizer to separate solrizer base from fedora-solrizer 

Added TerminologyBasedSolrizer
Added Extremely Configurable FieldMapper
Updated FieldNameMapper to use new FieldMapper

h2. 0.1.2

Minor: switched active-fedora gem requirement to >= 1.1.5 instead of = 1.1.5 (was breaking apps that use later versions of active-fedora)
