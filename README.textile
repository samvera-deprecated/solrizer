h1. solrizer

A lightweight, configurable tool for indexing metadata into solr.  Can be triggered from within your application, from the command line, or as a JMS listener.

Solrizer provides the baseline and structures for the process of solrizing.  In order to actually read objects from a 
datasource and write solr documents into a solr instance, you need to use an implementation specific gem, such as 
"solrizer-fedora":https://github.com/projecthydra/solrizer-fedora, which provides the mechanics for reading from a fedora repository and writing to a solr instance. 


h2. Installation

The gem is hosted on rubygems.org. The best way to manage the gems for your project is to use bundler.  Create a Gemfile in the root of your application and include the following:

<pre>
source "http://rubygems.org"

gem 'solrizer'
</pre>

Then:

<pre>bundle install</pre>

h2. Usage

h3. Fire up the console:

The code snippets in the following sections can be cut/paste into your console, giving you the opportunity to play with Solrizer 
and demonstrate the functionality underlying the implementation-specific gems, such as solrizer-fedora.



Start up a console and load solrizer:

<pre>
irb
require "rubygems"
require "solrizer"
</pre>


h3. Field Mapper

The FieldMapper maps term names and values to Solr fields, based on the term’s data type and any index_as options.  Solrizer comes with default mappings (which are defined in the config/solr_mappings.yml):

<pre>
default_mapper = Solrizer::FieldMapper::Default.new

# some of the default mappings in solrizer
default_mapper.solr_name("foo",:string)                 # returns foo_t
default_mapper.solr_name("foo",:date)                   # returns foo_dt
default_mapper.solr_name("foo",:integer)                # returns foo_i
default_mapper.solr_name("foo",:string,:facetable)      # returns foo_facet
default_mapper.solr_name("foo",:text,:facetable)        # returns foo_facet
default_mapper.solr_name("foo",:integer,:facetable)     # returns foo_facet
</pre>

FieldMapper provides some defaults:

<pre>
default_mapper.solr_names_and_values("foo","bar",:string,[:facetable])                    # returns searchable and facetable by default => {"foo_facet"=>["bar"], "foo_t"=>["bar"]}
default_mapper.solr_names_and_values("foo","bar",:string,[:not_searchable, :facetable])   # returns just facetable => {"foo_facet"=>["bar"]}
</pre>

Which can be tweaked:

<pre>
default_mapper.default_index_types << :facetable
default_mapper.solr_names_and_values("foo","bar",:string,[])                              # returns searchable and facetable by default => {"foo_facet"=>["bar"], "foo_t"=>["bar"]}
</pre>

Custom Mappings can also be provided (with custom converters):

<pre>
class CustomMapper < Solrizer::FieldMapper
  index_as :searchable, :suffix => "_search" do |type|
    type.reversed :suffix => "_reverse" do |value|
      value.reverse
    end
  end
end
</pre>

<pre>
custom_mapper = CustomMapper.new

custom_mapper.solr_names_and_values("foo","bar",:string,[:searchable])      # returns {"foo_search"=>["bar"]}
custom_mapper.solr_names_and_values("foo","bar",:reversed,[:searchable])    # returns {"foo_reverse"=>["rab"]}
</pre>

For more detailed information on custom mappings, see the documetnation for the FieldMapper class.

h3. Extractor and Extractor Mixins

Solrizer::Extractor provides utilities for extracting solr fields from objects or inserting solr fields into documents:

<pre>
extractor = Solrizer::Extractor.new

extractor.format_node_value(["foo     ","\n      bar"])                     # returns "foo bar"

solr_doc = Hash.new
extractor.insert_solr_field_value(solr_doc, "foo","bar")         # solr_doc is now {"foo" => ["bar"]}
extractor.insert_solr_field_value(solr_doc,"foo","baz")    # solr_doc is now {"foo" => ["bar","baz"]}
extractor.insert_solr_field_value(solr_doc, "boo","hoo")         # solr_doc is now {"foo" => ["bar","baz"], "boo" => ["hoo"]}
</pre>

h4. Solrizer provides some default mixins:

* Solrizer::HTML::Extractor     -=>  provides html_to_solr method
* Solrizer::XML::Extractor      -=>  provides xml_to_solr method

<pre>
xml = "<fields><foo>bar</foo><bar>baz</bar></fields>"

extractor.xml_to_solr(xml)      # returns {:foo_t=>"bar", :bar_t=>"baz"}
</pre>

h4. Solrizer::XML::TerminologyBasedSolrizer

Another powerful mixin for use with classes that include the OM::XML::Document module is Solrizer::XML::TerminologyBasedSolrizer.  
The methods provided by this module map provides a robust way of mapping terms and solr fields via om terminologies.  A notable example 
can be found in ActiveFedora::NokogiriDatatstream.


h2. JMS Listener for Hydra Rails Applications

h3. The executables: solrizer and solrizerd

The solrizer gem provides two executables:

 * solrizer is a stomp consumer which listens for fedora.apim.updates and solrizes (or de-solrizes) objects accordingly. 
 * solrizerd is a wrapper script that spawns a daemonized version of solrizer and handles start|stop|restart|status requests. 

h3. Usage 

The usage for solrizerd is as follows: 

<pre>
 solrizerd command --hydra_home PATH [options] 
</pre>

The commands are as follows:
 *  start      start an instance of the application 
 *  stop       stop all instances of the application 
 *  restart    stop all instances and restart them afterwards 
 *  status     show status (PID) of application instances 

Required parameters:

--hydra_home: this is the path to your hydra rails applications' root directory.  Solrizerd needs this in order to load all your models and corresponding terminoligies.

The options:
 *  -p, --port         Stomp port  61613 
 *  -o, --host         Host to connect to  localhost 
 *  -u, --user         User name for stomp listener  
 *  -w, --password     Password for stomp listener  
 *  -d, --destination  Topic to listen to (default: /topic/fedora.apim.update) 
 *  -h, --help         Display this screen 

Note:

Since the solrizer script must fire up your hydra rails application, it must have all the gems installed that your hydra instance needs.


h2. Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rake file, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
